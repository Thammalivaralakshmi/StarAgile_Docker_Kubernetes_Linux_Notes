Linux
==============
=> What is an OS?
OS is a software which is used to interact with the machines
OS acts as a mediator between the user and the machine
OS is mandatory to work with any device
It provides an environment to run applications

=> Types of OS?
2 types of OS;
Windows
MacOS
Andriod
Linux
Ubuntu
....

=> Windows Vs Linux
Windows is a single user based OS
Linux is multi-user based OS

Windows OS is premium
Linux OS is free and open-source

Windows OS is less secure
Linux OS is highly secure

Windows OS is developed and owned by Microsoft organization
Linux OS is developed by Linus Torvalds

Windows OS is recommended for personal use
Linux OS is purely meant for professional use

Windows OS is GUI (Graphical User Interface) based
Linux OS is CLI (Command Line Interface) based

100 Commands ---- tell me some important commands

=> Linux Distributions
Biryani  -----> Hyderabad
Chennai/Bangalore ----> Hyderabad Biryani shop

Linux

On top of Linux OS, cloud vendors has modified the original code of the Linux and then they called it as Amazon Linux -----> Linux Distributions

Two types of Linux Distributions;
	1. RPM based - RedHat Package Manager
		AMIs -----> Amazon Linux, CentOS, redhat......
	2. Debian based
		AMIs ----> Ubuntu 24.04, 22.03, Suse...

=> Working with Linux OS
		AWS -----> EC2 -----> Amazon Linux 2023 -----> PublicIP Address -----> MobaXTerm (.pem) -----> All commands will be executed

=> Linux Commands - Part 1 - Basics

Note: All servers in AWS Cloud will follow UTC (Universal Coordinate Time) time-zone

date
cal (or) cal -1
cal 2026
cal january 2026
clear (or) control + l
pwd
cat /etc/os-release

Types of users in Linux;
2 types of users;
	1. ec2-user	-----> ec2-user has less permissions such as to install packages, to create users....
	2. root		-----> root user has all kinds of permissions

Can we create custom users?
YES

whoami
sudo su
exit (or) control + d

			pwd
ec2-user ---------------------> /home/ec2-user	-----> $ symbol in the end

			pwd
sudo su ----------------------> /home/ec2-user	-----> # symbol in the end

			pwd	
sudo -i -----------------------> /root				-----> # symbol in the end 

history
history -c
man pwd
whoami --help

sudo yum install bc -y
bc
Perform any mathematical operation

which ls
which git
which mvn

Default directory structure of Linux;
cd /
ls
You will see the Linux directory structure

ls

=> Creating Directories in Linux
What is a directory?
Directory is nothing but a folder in Linux 

mkdir kastro
mkdir folder1 folder2 folder3
cd folder1

Relative Path & Absolute Path
Absolute Path --- it means we should give the complete path in a single command (cd ec2-user/folder1/folder1.1/folder1.2/folder1.3/folder1.4/)
Relative Path --- it means we need to inside one specific directory at a time (cd ec2-user, cd folder1, cd folder1.1, cd folder1.2, cd folder1.3, cd folder1.4)

cd -	-----> It will take to the previously worked location
cd ~ -----> It will take to /home/ec2-user

Nested Directories;
mkdir -p linux_day01/aws/ec2/ebs/elb/asg

rmdir folder2
rmdir folder3 kastro kiran

rm -rf folder1.2

What is inode (Index Node)?
ls -i
ls -lrthi
find . -inum 50729448
